# SOLID-Principles-with-Real-Life-Examples

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
