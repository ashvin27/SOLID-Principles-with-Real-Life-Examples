# SOLID-Principles-with-Real-Life-Examples

1. **Single Responsibility Principle ([SRP](https://github.com/ashvin27/SOLID-Principles-with-Real-Life-Examples/blob/main/srp.md)):** A class should have only one reason to change.

2. **Open/Closed Principle ([OCP](https://github.com/ashvin27/SOLID-Principles-with-Real-Life-Examples/blob/main/ocp.md)):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle ([LSP](https://github.com/ashvin27/SOLID-Principles-with-Real-Life-Examples/blob/main/lsp.md)):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle ([ISP](https://github.com/ashvin27/SOLID-Principles-with-Real-Life-Examples/blob/main/isp.md)):** A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle ([DIP](https://github.com/ashvin27/SOLID-Principles-with-Real-Life-Examples/blob/main/dip.md)):** High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
